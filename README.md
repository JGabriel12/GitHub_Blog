## GitHub Blog

<br>
This is a **React** application built using **TypeScript**, Vite, **Axios**, **React Router**, React Hook Form with Zod, Styled Components, and Moment.js for date formatting. The application consumes the GitHub API to display a blog-like interface, where the user's profile is dynamically fetched from GitHub data. Below the user profile, a list of issues from the selected repository is displayed. Users can click on an issue to view its detailed body and see the number of comments it has.
